[Cognitive Performance and Labour Market Outcomes.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537117303329)
with Randall Lutter and Christopher J.Ruhm. *Labour Economics 51 (2018): 121-135*.

We use the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and other sources to examine how cognitive performance near the end of secondary schooling relates to labour market outcomes through age fifty. Our preferred estimates control for individual and family backgrounds, non-cognitive attributes, and survey years. We find that returns to cognitive skills rise with age. Although estimated gains in lifetime incomes are close to those reported earlier, our preferred estimates make multiple offsetting improvements. Returns to cognitive skill are greater for blacks and Hispanics than for non-Hispanic whites, both in relative and absolute terms, with gains in work hours being more important than in hourly wages.

Breastfeeding, Schooling and Income: Insights from the Indonesian Family Life Survey.
with Randall Lutter, Christopher J.Ruhm and Siying Liu. Forthcoming at *Maternal and Child Nutrition*.

Recent research has highlighted associations of breastfeeding with IQ, schooling and income, but uncertainty about such links remains. The Indonesian Family Life Survey, representative of 83% of the Indonesian population, provides data on breastfeeding, parents’ years of schooling, wealth and other family characteristics in 1993-94, as well as schooling and income in 2014-2015 for 5421 children of those families. Using linear regressions and controlling for village or neighborhood, as well as propensity score matching, we analyzed breastfeeding associations for boys and girls separately. When regularly fed foods / beverages other than breast milk is significantly associated with years of schooling in 2014-2015 for girls, but not for boys, after controlling for the village or neighborhood of residence in 1993-94. For girls, ages 1 to 1.9, 2 to 2.9, 3 to 3.9, and > 4 months, relative to ages < 1 month, are associated with an additional 0.41 to 0.46 years of schooling, with p-values of 0.086, 0.071, 0.043, and 0.026, respectively. No comparable estimate for boys attains statistical significance. Using propensity score matching yields similar results. Associations with annual income in 2014-2015 are not statistically significant, either for all children, or for either sex. Our finding suggests that delaying regular feeding of foods / beverages other than breast milk beyond one month may help girls’ schooling but has no observable association with annual income, perhaps because of lower labor force participation by women. Also, the inclusion of controls for village or neighborhood of residence reduces confounding.
